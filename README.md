# RSA-algorithm
RSA algorithm application. The application was written in 2004 in Java 2 language version 1.4, but it runs without any problems on newer Java machines. Graphical interface made with Swing library. The application encrypts with 512-bit key by default. The program works on text files, which after encryption are saved as files with the extension *.kod . The cipher key consists of two files :     1. a file with the extension *.kpr - a private key in which the numbers p, q and b are stored a key used to decrypt the file,     2. a file with the extension *.kpu - a public key used to encrypt the message. It consists of the numbers n and b.  In application to represent large numbers BigInteger class was used. This class is standard supplied to all Java distributions.
